The book is set to talk about myself, what I've gone through, and how I see myself. This book is written in the 3rd person of singularity because I don't want to be placed as "I" but rather as "He". And the stiory starts after my suicidal attempts and also 10 years after my intensive bullying.

Author Bio
Hello, I'm nerfine. 19 years old, nearly 20. And I've always enjoyed writing, playing video games, and editing.



Nerfine looked at himself in the mirror, his reflection staring back at him with a mixture of disgust and self-loathing. 
He hated himself, hated the life he had led, hated the mistakes he had made. 
He felt like a failure, a disappointment to everyone who had ever known him.

His life had been a series of unfortunate events and poor choices. 
He had always been a bit of a misfit, never quite fitting in with the other kids. 
He was shy and introverted, and he often found himself being bullied and ostracized.

As he grew older, Nerfine's life didn't get any better. 
He made a series of bad decisions that led him down a path of self-destruction. 
He dropped out of school, got into trouble with the law, and ended up with a string of failed relationships.

He was constantly haunted by the mistakes he had made. 
He couldn't forgive himself for the pain he had caused others. 
He felt like he was a bad person, and that he deserved all the bad things that had happened to him.

The weight of his guilt was crushing. 
He felt like he was drowning in his own self-hatred. 
He was constantly fighting the urge to give up, to just end it all.
